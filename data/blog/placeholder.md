# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation for React applications. It's designed to make it easy to build fast, SEO-friendly web applications.

## Why Next.js?

- **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: Next.js renders pages on the server, which improves performance and SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Generate static HTML at build time for even better performance.
- **API Routes**: Create API endpoints as part of your Next.js application.
- **File-based Routing**: Create routes based on the file structure in your pages directory.
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Import CSS files directly in your components.

## Setting Up Your First Project

To create a new Next.js project, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-next-app
